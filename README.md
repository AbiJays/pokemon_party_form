## Brief

Your task is to create a front-end JavaScript application that allows users to input items and see them displayed in a list. Choose a theme for the application, such as a list of endangered Animals / favourite Sports Stars / any other theme of your choice. Users should be able to enter values for different properties relating to the theme (Name, Species and Continent, for example) and see them displayed below.
